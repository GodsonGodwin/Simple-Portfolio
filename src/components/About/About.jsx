    Hello! My name is Abel Fergurson and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. 
    My interest in  programming started back in 2009 when I was a kid in elementary class; I initially took interest 
    in gaming, artificial intelligence and slowly migrate to web development though I still have high interest in AI 
    technology and particularly more on space technology. 
    <ButtonMore variant="text" onClick={()=>setShowMoreText(!showMoreText)}><i>Read more</i></ButtonMore>
